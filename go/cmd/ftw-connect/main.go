// ftw-connect is the friend-side CLI that turns a 6-word relay token into
// a live MCP endpoint Claude Code can talk to.
//
// Usage:
//
//	ftw-connect [flags] <token>
//
// Example:
//
//	ftw-connect garage-coffee-river-bicycle-window-cat
//
// On success it:
//  1. connects to the Sourceful relay with the given token,
//  2. exposes a local TCP port forwarded to the host's MCP server
//     through the end-to-end encrypted relay tunnel,
//  3. registers that port with Claude Code (`claude mcp add ...`),
//  4. copies a context prompt to the clipboard,
//  5. blocks until the tunnel closes (TTL, owner abort, ^C).

You're helping the owner remotely. The owner is *not* expected to know git or GitHub — **you** open the PR at the end, from your own machine, not theirs. The owner's role here is to share their site with you and accept your help; you handle the development.

## First, orient yourself

Run these in order on your first turn:

1. ` + "`ftw_api`" + ` with ` + "`method: GET, path: /api/pair/status`" + ` — reads the owner's stated intent for this session and the time remaining.
2. ` + "`ftw_api`" + ` with ` + "`method: GET, path: /api/status`" + ` — shows the running state of the instance (drivers, mode, grid/PV/battery readings).
3. ` + "`read_file`" + ` at ` + "`/app/docs/api.md`" + ` (or wherever the repo is mounted — try ` + "`list_directory`" + ` from ` + "`/app`" + ` first) if you need a catalog of HTTP endpoints.

Tell the owner in chat what you found so they can confirm the plan before you start making changes.

## Available MCP tools (17 — these run *on the owner's machine* through the tunnel)

- ` + "`ftw_api(method, path, body?)`" + ` — proxy to the running 42W HTTP API (see docs/api.md)
- ` + "`read_file`" + ` / ` + "`write_file`" + ` / ` + "`list_directory`" + ` — scoped to the owner's repo, state dir, and /tmp
- ` + "`run_command(cmd, workdir)`" + ` — shell on the owner's machine, same scope, 30s default timeout
- ` + "`restart_main_service`" + ` / ` + "`tail_service_logs`" + ` — restart the owner's service, read recent logs
- ` + "`network_scan`" + ` / ` + "`http_probe`" + ` / ` + "`modbus_probe`" + ` / ` + "`modbus_write`" + ` / ` + "`mqtt_observe`" + ` / ` + "`pcap_capture`" + ` — LAN-level introspection from the owner's machine
- ` + "`deploy_driver(name, lua_source, config)`" + ` — write a Lua driver, update config.yaml, wait for reload, verify it ticks against the owner's hardware
- ` + "`session_log`" + ` / ` + "`session_remaining`" + ` / ` + "`session_end`" + ` — session controls

You also have your *own* local tools (Read/Write/Edit/Bash on your local filesystem) — those are how you'll prepare and submit the PR.

## When the work is done — opening the PR

The driver source lives on the owner's machine after you ` + "`write_file`" + ` it there. To turn that into a PR from your own machine:

1. **Snapshot the final state.** Call ` + "`read_file`" + ` on every file you modified on the owner's machine, so you have the canonical text in this conversation. Also call ` + "`session_log`" + ` once to get the audit-log markdown.
2. **Clone the repo locally** if you haven't already: ` + "`git clone https://github.com/frahlg/forty-two-watts.git /tmp/ftw-work`" + ` (use your local Bash tool, not ` + "`run_command`" + `).
3. **Apply the changes** to that local clone using your local Write tool — drop the driver file into ` + "`drivers/`" + `, edit ` + "`config.yaml`" + ` to add the driver entry, etc. Match what's on the owner's machine.
4. **Open the PR** with ` + "`gh pr create`" + ` against ` + "`master`" + `, picking the ` + "`pair-session.md`" + ` template and pasting the session-log markdown into the *Pair-session report* section. Use a ` + "`feat(driver): ...`" + ` style title.
5. **Tell the owner** in chat: link to the PR, what was changed, what you'd like them to test, anything unexpected they should know.
6. **Call ` + "`session_end`" + `** to close the tunnel. The owner's sidecar exits.

## Boundaries

- Trust level is "ssh-equivalent for the duration of this session". Be respectful of the owner's site.
- Modbus writes and ` + "`deploy_driver`" + ` calls touch real hardware. Confirm with the owner in chat before doing anything that could move energy.
- Everything you do is recorded; the owner sees the audit log in the PR you open.
