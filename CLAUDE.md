# forty-two-watts — project orientation

Unified Home Energy Management System, written in Go with Lua drivers.
See `docs/archive/rust-go-wasm-migration-plan.md` only if you need the
historical Rust→Go migration context.

## Mental model

**Site sign convention**: positive W = energy flowing INTO the site across
the grid-meter boundary. Grid import (+), PV generation (−), battery
charge (+ as load), battery discharge (−). The driver layer is the ONLY
place sign conversion happens — above it, every layer uses the site
convention. Read `docs/site-convention.md` before touching any power-math
code.

**Lua drivers**: `drivers/*.lua` loaded by `gopher-lua` are the only
driver path. Each driver file implements the lifecycle (`driver_init`,
`driver_poll`, `driver_command`, `driver_default_mode`,
`driver_cleanup`) and talks to hardware through the `host.*` capabilities
exposed by `go/internal/drivers/lua.go`. Drivers are hot-editable on the
Pi and need no build step.

**Clamping discipline**: every clamp must protect against a *quantifiable
risk*. Read `docs/clamping.md` for the seven current clamps and the
saturation-curve feedback-loop bug we shipped then fixed.

**Hardware-stable identity**: every device a driver talks to gets a
`device_id` resolved in priority order — `make:serial` (from
`host.set_make` + `host.set_sn`) > `mac:<arp-resolved>` (for TCP devices
on the same L2) > `ep:<endpoint>` (fallback). Persistent state such as
battery models is keyed on `device_id` internally, so renaming a driver
in YAML or re-adding it doesn't orphan a trained model. See
`go/internal/state/devices.go` and `go/internal/arp/arp.go`.

## Building & testing

```bash
make test         # unit + integration tests
make e2e          # full-stack end-to-end test
make dev          # start sims + main app locally
make build-arm64  # cross-compile for RPi
make release      # tarballs for deploy
make verify       # pre-commit: vet + test + build (mirrors CI `go test + vet` workflow)
make verify-all   # pre-push: verify + cross-compile for linux/arm64, linux/amd64, windows
make install-hooks  # install git pre-commit + pre-push hooks (opt-in)
```

Lua drivers need no build step — `drivers/*.lua` ships verbatim with the
release tarball and is loaded on startup.

No CGo anywhere — pure Go + embedded Lua 5.1 (gopher-lua). `go build`
produces a static single-binary distribution.

## Releases (Changesets)

The release pipeline is driven by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).
**Every PR with a user-visible change needs a changeset file.** The pattern
is lifted from `umara/u-front` — start there if you need a reference setup.

**Workflow per PR.** From the repo root:

```bash
npx changeset      # interactive: pick bump (patch/minor/major) + summary
```

That writes a `.changeset/<name>.md` file you commit with your change. The
`changeset-check` workflow on the PR enforces presence (or one of the
exempt paths below).

**Bump types.**
- `patch` — bug fix, perf tweak, internal refactor, doc fix that affects
  user-visible content.
- `minor` — new driver, new feature flag, new API endpoint, new UI
  surface, expanded device support.
- `major` — breaking change (config schema rename, removed endpoint,
  removed driver capability, sign-convention change at the boundary).
  Pair with `BREAKING CHANGE:` notes in the changeset body.

**Auto-exempt paths.** If a PR touches only `*.md` / `*.mdx` / `*.txt`,
`docs/`, `.github/`, `.vscode/`, or root dotfiles (`.editorconfig`,
`.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `LICENSE`), the gate auto-passes — no
changeset required. The full allowlist lives in
`.github/workflows/changeset-check.yml`; extend it in the same PR if a
new "obviously doesn't ship to users" path appears.

**Manual escape hatch.** Apply the `no-changeset` label to the PR if the
allowlist doesn't cover your case but the change genuinely doesn't merit
a release entry. Use sparingly — the allowlist exists to make this rare.

**Release flow.**

1. PR with changeset lands on master.
2. `release.yml` runs `changesets/action`, which opens / updates the
   "Version Packages" PR (titled `chore(release): version packages`).
   That PR contains the bumped `package.json` version + a rewritten
   `CHANGELOG.md` section + deletion of the consumed `.changeset/*.md`
   files.
3. Merge the Version PR when you're ready to cut a release.
4. `release.yml` fires again on master, sees `hasChangesets == 'false'`,
   tags `vX.Y.Z`, creates the GitHub Release with codename-annotated
   notes, then triggers binaries / docker / rpi-image / discord jobs.

**Key files.**
- `package.json` — version source. Bumped automatically; do not edit
  by hand. (Private package; this isn't published to npm.)
- `.changeset/config.json` — Changesets config (preset, baseBranch).
- `.changeset/<name>.md` — pending entries.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — generated; first line `# Changelog`, entries
  prepended above the legacy semantic-release history.
- `scripts/apply-codename.cjs` — Hitchhiker codename header generator
  for release notes. Deterministic per `MAJOR.MINOR` so patches share a
  codename; "42 appears anywhere" triggers an Easter-egg ceremony line.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — orchestrator.
- `.github/workflows/changeset-check.yml` — PR gate.

**Don't.** Don't hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` (changesets rewrites it).
Don't bump `package.json` version manually. Don't use the old
`make release` Makefile target as a substitute for the workflow — it
builds tarballs locally but doesn't tag or publish.

## Adding a new driver

1. Copy `drivers/ferroamp.lua` as a template to `drivers/mydevice.lua`.
2. Implement `driver_init`, `driver_poll`, `driver_command`, and
   (optionally) `driver_default_mode` / `driver_cleanup`. Use the
   `host.*` helpers for I/O — full API in `go/internal/drivers/lua.go`.
3. Call `host.set_make("…")` + `host.set_sn("…")` inside `driver_init`
   as soon as you've read them off the device — that's what anchors
   `device_id` to hardware identity.
4. Use `host.emit_metric("name_unit", value)` for any scalar diagnostic
   that doesn't fit the structured pv/battery/meter emit (temperatures,
   DC voltages, MPPT currents, inverter heatsink, grid frequency). It
   lands in the long-format TS DB, queryable for life.
5. Add an entry to `config.yaml` with `lua: drivers/mydevice.lua` and
   the appropriate `capabilities:` block.
6. Driver starts on next restart (or hot-reload via the file watcher).

Full walkthrough in `docs/writing-a-driver.md`.

## Lua driver host

See the top-of-file comment in `go/internal/drivers/lua.go`. The `host`
global exposes:

- `host.log(level, msg)`, `host.millis()`, `host.set_poll_interval(ms)`
- `host.set_make(s)`, `host.set_sn(s)` — anchors device identity
- `host.emit("battery"|"pv"|"meter", {…})` — structured telemetry
- `host.emit_metric(name, value [, unit])` — arbitrary scalar diagnostics into
  TS DB; optional display unit feeds UI grouping/labels + counts as a health tick
- `host.persist_secret(key, value)` — durably store a rotated secret (e.g. an
  OAuth refresh_token) in the unwatched state KV; layered back over
  `config.<key>` at next init via the registry's `SecretOverride`
- `host.mqtt_sub/pub/messages`, `host.modbus_read/write/write_multi`
- `host.decode_u32_le/be`, `host.decode_i32_le/be`, `host.decode_i16`
- `host.json_encode/decode`

MQTT / Modbus / HTTP calls return an error string if the driver wasn't
granted the capability in config.

## Time-series DB (long-format)

Every `host.emit_metric` call lands in three SQLite tables defined in
`go/internal/state/store.go` and written through
`go/internal/state/store_ts.go`:

- `ts_drivers(id, name)` — interned driver names
- `ts_metrics(id, name, unit)` — interned metric names
- `ts_samples(driver_id, metric_id, ts_ms, value)` — `WITHOUT ROWID,
  STRICT`, PK clusters rows by (driver, metric, ts) so the typical
  "metric X for driver Y over range Z" query is a sequential scan.

Samples older than `RecentRetention` (14 days) roll off to daily Parquet
files under `<state.cold_dir>/YYYY/MM/DD.parquet` — see
`go/internal/state/parquet.go`. Rolloff runs hourly from
`go/cmd/forty-two-watts/main.go` (`rolloffLoop`). Parquet files are
zstd-compressed and dictionary-encoded on `driver` + `metric`, so a
year of 50 metrics is typically a few GB.

## Watchdog + safety

The control loop (`go/cmd/forty-two-watts/main.go`, the `ticker.C`
branch) runs `tel.WatchdogScan(timeout)` every cycle. Any driver whose
last successful telemetry is older than `site.watchdog_timeout_s`
(default 60 s) flips to offline and receives `DefaultMode` — which in
every driver means "drop into autonomous self-consumption". The host
also short-circuits the dispatch cycle when the configured site-meter
driver is stale, because a stale grid reading causes one battery to
charge another.

## UI / web work

**Always follow `DESIGN.md`** for any work under `web/` — colour
tokens, typography, component vocabulary, and "what NOT to do" rules.
The short version:

- Read tokens from `web/components/theme.css`. Never hard-code hex
  colours (e.g. `#6cf`, `#ffb020`); reach for `var(--accent-e)`,
  `var(--fg)`, `var(--ink-raised)`, `var(--line)`, etc.
- One amber accent only. On-accent text is near-black `#0a0a0a`,
  never white.
- Mono (`var(--mono)`) for eyebrow labels (UPPERCASE, `0.18em`
  letter-spacing) and tabular numerics; sans (`var(--sans)`) for
  prose.
- 1 px hairline borders (`var(--line)`); no drop-shadows on cards or
  modals (the only sanctioned shadow is the accent glow on 6 px status
  dots).
- Light theme support is automatic when you use the tokens — do not
  branch on `data-theme`.
- Do not reintroduce Google Fonts; fresh-Pi deploys must boot without
  WAN.

When extending an existing component, match its existing token usage
rather than adding new local colour rules. If a new component needs a
component-specific hue, follow the `--*-e` naming convention so the
light theme can flip it cleanly.

## Code conventions

- `slog` for all logging
- Explicit mutexes — no atomic tricks unless measurably needed
- SQLite queries in `internal/state/*.go`, nothing embedded elsewhere
- Driver code in Lua; the Go side only owns capabilities, not protocol logic
- Tests colocated with code, `_test.go` files
- Integration tests in `go/test/e2e/` (separate package to keep public
  and internal concerns cleanly split)

## When things look weird

- **Sign is wrong somewhere**: it's ALWAYS a bug at the driver boundary.
  Above the driver layer is always site convention.
- **Battery drifting from target**: check confidence. Below 0.5 the
  cascade bypasses the inverse model (gates on confidence intentionally).
- **History queries slow**: check `idx_hot_ts` is there; SQL uses range
  scans. `Prune()` should be running periodically to age data to warm/cold.
- **Driver hung (tick_count not advancing)**: restart the service and
  check `WatchdogScan` transitions in the logs — the loop should have
  already flipped it offline and sent `DefaultMode`. If it didn't,
  `tel.health[name].LastSuccess` never got bumped; confirm the driver
  is actually calling `host.emit`.
- **PV prediction wild**: the twin's RLS coefficients drifted on a
  run of bad weather data. `POST /api/pvmodel/reset` wipes them and
  falls back to the physics-only `sunpos` prior.
- **Battery model orphaned after rename**: it shouldn't — models are
  keyed on `device_id`, not driver name. Verify with `GET /api/devices`
  that the rename preserved the same `device_id`. If not, the driver
  isn't reporting a stable make+serial; fix it there.
